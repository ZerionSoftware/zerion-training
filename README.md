# Zerion Training Resource Library
## Introduction
Welcome to the Zerion Training Resource Library! This repository is dedicated to growing a large set of training exemplars. Feel free to download, import, and test any exemplar. Also, submit issues and let us know if something isn't working as intended or you're having trouble. Your learning is our benefit!
## How To Use This Repository
There are three categories of exemplars:
- **Form Packages**
- **Dataflows**
- **Multi-Service Solutions**

Within each folder, individual exemplars are stored in their own folder. This folder contains a `README.md` file and a compressed folder that can be downloaded for import. Be sure to read each project's `README.md` file for instructions in how to use the exemplar as well as a description of the solution.
### Finding Issues
We try our best but sometimes bugs come up. If you find a bug in a solution, please submit a ticket by clicking on the `Issues` tab and then the `New issue` button.
